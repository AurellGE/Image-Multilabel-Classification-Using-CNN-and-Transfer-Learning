# Multi-label Image Classification using CNN

This project aims to classify images into multiple labels based on the given dataset. The goal is to predict the correct labels associated with each image, where each image can have multiple labels simultaneously.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Multi-label Image Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meherunnesashraboni/multi-label-image-classification-dataset/data) from Kaggle. This dataset contains images categorized under multiple labels, making it suitable for multi-label classification tasks.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to predict the correct labels for each image using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN will learn to recognize patterns in the images and classify them into one or more categories.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (for CNN model)
- scikit-multilearn (for multi-label classification)
- scikit-learn (for train-test splitting)
- tqdm (for progress bar)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Libraries Used

- TensorFlow - For building and training the CNN model.
- scikit-learn - For data preprocessing and splitting.
- scikit-multilearn - For handling multi-label classification.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn - For data visualization.
- PIL - For image handling.
